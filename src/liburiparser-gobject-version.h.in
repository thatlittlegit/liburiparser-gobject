 * @short_description: liburiparser-gobject version checking
 *
 * Liburiparser-GObject provides macros to check the version of the library
 * at compile-time. It also provides macros to get the version of liburiparser
 * being used behind the scenes.
 *
 * Liburiparser-GObject complies with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org),
 * which means that parts of the version number will only change at certain
 * times.
 *
 * > This library currently has a major version of 0, meaning that it's in
 * > development: here, don't assume much backwards compatibility, especially
 * > not ABI compatibility.
 *
 * 1. The major version will only be updated with breaking changes;
 * 2. The minor version will be updated with new features and 100% backwards
 *    compatibility;
 * 3. The patch version will be updated with bugfixes, etc.
 *
 * Liburiparser seems to follow something like SemVer as well.
